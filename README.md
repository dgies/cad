# dgies' CAD Projects 
A collection of code-as-cad personal projects.

## iMac Bridge
Uses SolidPython to generate a 'bridge' for holding a variable number of circular beams at a regular horizontal spacing.
The `make_beam` method could be reused in other projects for parametric beams.
Run with `python3 bridge.py` to generate a SCAD file, then load that into OpenSCAD to generate STL

_Named because it was designed to hold dowels to hang little toy iMacs for painting with primer._

## Soap Dish

## Triangle Soap Dish

Implemented in CadQuery and stored in a Jupyter notebook for interactive debugging. 

## Umbrella Hook v4
